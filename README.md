CMSI 387: Computer Graphics
===========================

This is a repository for the code I wrote during my spring semester in 2013 for the class titled Computer Graphics.

The `.pdf` of the syllabus is also uploaded here but for easiness, I have included the most important information in this `README.md`.

### Objectives and Outcomes

This course explores the computer science subfield of computer graphicsâ€”the study and development of algorithms for synthesizing, manipulating, and displaying visual information. Long after the course concludes, my hope is that you will be able to:

1. Represent, model, and create visual information digitally.
2. Manipulate and display visual information in 2D and 3D.
3. Use and develop computer graphics APIs in both 2D and 3D.
